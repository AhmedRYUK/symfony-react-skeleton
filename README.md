### XDEBUG setup in PphStorm (with first debug call)
Xdebug is configured out of the box in container for all CLI commands, for browser I recommend to install [Xdebug helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc), or other similar tool to add XDEBUG_SESSION cookie to requests.

1. Click on "Start listening for PHP Debug Connection"
2. Perform any request from your browser (with a XDEBUG_SESSION cookie, see description few lines before)
3. If asked by PhpStorm to provide server mappings, do it like this ![xdebug-mappings.png](documentation%2Fimages%2Fxdebug-mappings.png)
